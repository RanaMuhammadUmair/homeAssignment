As in assigment solution we have two folders.
1. clicker-spa (contain react single page application).
2. ClickerAPI (contains dotnet web api application)

First we need to run backend. By changing directory to ClickerAPI and run this command on cmd 'dotnet run'
After that we need to run react frontend by changing directory to clicker-spa, then run this command on cmd npm start. 
it will open default broswer with app. 

Presistance storage is stored on file "counterValue.txt"
if this file exist program will take value from it. otherwise program will generate this file and start updating it.
